Notepad++ v6.2 includes a new User Defined Languge (UDL2) system, the key features of UDL2 are:

1.  More keyword groups were added (more syntax highlighting can be defined):
  - 3 folding groups
  - 8 keyword groups
  - 2 comment groups
  - 1 number definitons
  - 2 operators groups
  - 8 delimiter sets
2.  Multipart keywords are supported (for example: "else if" can be defined as a single keyword)
3.  Whitespace is no longer mandatory as keyword separator: Operators, Delimiters and Folding keywords can be recognized with or without whitespace separators.
4.  Numbers recognition support is greatly improved (prefix, suffix, range and extra symbols supported).
5.  Operators and delimiters can be longer than one character.
6.  The same characters can be used as comments AND operators.
7.  Comments and delimiters support nesting (even within each other).
8.  Improvments to Comments include:
  - Comment folding
  - Comment continuation
  - Comment only start at the beginning of line
9.  In the case of several comment pairs defined, comment open symbols match only with comment close symbols of the same order. (for example: /* C comment */, /+ D comment +/, but not /* mixed comment +/)
