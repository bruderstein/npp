<h1>Plugins
</h1><p>
Notepad++
is very extensible using so called plugins. Plugins are small or big
additions to Notpead++ to enhance its functionality. Notepad++ comes
bundled with a few plugins (when using the installer, you
can choose which ones to add), but you can always add your own or
remove some. The plugins are located in the Plugins directory in the
main Notepad++ installation directory. They are DLL files and simply
removing or adding them is enough.
<p>
When Notepad++ starts, it looks into its Plugins configuration folder and loads whatever dll it finds. Later, you can add plugins using the <span class="menu_item">Settings -> Import -> Import plugins</span> menu.
Be
careful to make sure your version of Notepad++ is up-to-date enough
for new plugins and that the plugin is compatible with Notepad++
(some very old plugins will not work with newer versions of
Notepad++, it is up to the developer of the plugin to add support or
not).
<p>
Currently,
Notepad++ can be found in an (older) ANSI version and the newer
Unicode verison. The plugin has to match this version, otherwise it
will not work (Notepad++ will warn you about this).
Plugins
can be found anywhere on the internet, but a large
can be found in the Notepad++ Plugins project on SourceForge.net:</font>
<a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/</a>. There is even a plugin, called Plugin Manager, which works out the installation details and version management for you.
<p>If a plugin misbehaves, Notepad++ will go out of its way to prevent the failure from propagating so as to avoid any loss of data. In such a case, you will be presented with information about the plugin reporting a problem. Making this information available on the Plugin Development forum will help removing the cause of the problem as soon as possible.
