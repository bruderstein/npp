<h1>Dialog-free search</h1>
<h2>Continued search</h2>
<p>After
a search inside a file, you can select <span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Find Next</span> or
<span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Find Previous</span> to search for this query again. This allows
you to quickly perform the same search multiple times without the
need for any further input.
<p>Likewise, you can use <span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Go to Next found result</span> or
<span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Go to Previous found result</span> to navigate through results shown on the <a href="Search%window.html">Search result window</a>
<h2>Volatile search</h2>
Volatile search consists in searching for a word under the caret without the need to open the search dialog box. This has two flavours:
<ul>
<li>
<span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Find (Volatile) Next</span> or
<span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Find (Volatile) Previous</span> find the next/previous occurence of the selected text, without affecting continued search.
<li>
<span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Select and Find Next</span> or
<span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Select and Find Previous</span> find the next/previous occurence of the word under the caret, and remember this search so that continued search applies to this same word.
</ul>
