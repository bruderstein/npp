<body><h1>Upgrading Notepad++</h1>
<p>Notepad++ is an actively maintained piece of software, and new versions come fast. There are basically three ways to keep abreast of changes:
<ul>
<li>Enabling the Auto Update feature. When a new version is released, and after 
some delay - 15 days -, you will be notified that a new version is available, 
and presented with the option of installing that newer version.
<li>Using the <span class="menu_item">? -> Update Notepad++</span> command.
This will check whether there is a new version and whether the safety dlay is 
over. If so, you are presented with the opportunity to download and install the 
newer version.
<li>Going to the <a href="Main%20Website.html">main website</a> and downloading the latest installer or zipped archive.
</ul>
<p>The safety delay is provided so that, in case a critical bug is spotted on a 
new release, a corrective release is done quickly enough, preventing bad bugs 
to become widespread.
