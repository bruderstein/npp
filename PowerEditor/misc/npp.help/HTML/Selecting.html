<body><h1>Selecting text</h1>
<p>As with any known text editor, you can select text using either the mouse or keyboard.
Selected text can be moved to some other part of the same document, copied elsewhere
in the same or another document, searched for text, deleted, an more.
</p><h2>How to select text</h2>
When using the mouse, the most basic way - but there are other - is to drag
 the mouse from start point to end point. You can also double click a word to 
select it, or triple click on a line to select it. The same effect is achieved 
by a simple click on the line number margin, when displayed.
You can extend a selection by shift clicking its new insertion point.
</p><p>When using the keyboard, the expected procedure is to use navigation keys
in conjunction with the <span class="Shortcut">Shift</span> modifier. These keyboard shortcuts can be changed at any time using the Shortcut Mapper.
</p><h2>Stream vs rectangular selection</h2>
<p>The above procedures are known to define a <i>stream</i> selection, which encompasses 
a contiguous range of text. 
</p><p>However, Notepad++ also knows about rectangular selections, which define a rectangle of strips on contiguous lines. To select a rectangle, use the
above methods while also holding the <span class="Shortcut">Alt</span> modifier key down. For exmple, the basic way with
the mouse is to <span class="Shortcut">Alt-click</span> the start point and Alt-move the mouse to the end point, and so forth. The Alt- versions of keyboard shortcuts can be changed as well.
</p><p>It is possible to combine a stream selection and arectangular selection, using the keyboard.
This is probably less useful, but is not a bug.
</p><p>The <span class="menu_item">Edit -> Line operations -> Move Up/Down current line</span> commands also move the selected area, if it is not rectangular. This ability is lost when several selections are made - see below.
</p><h2>Multiple stream selections</h2>
<p>If a stream area is selected, it is possible to add another, disjoint area by Ctrl-clicking its start point and moving the mouse to the end point.
More than one extra selection can be added this way. However, this ability
does not extend to rectangular selections. A rectangular selection may still cling to one of the stream selections though.
</p><p>When copying or cutting a multiple selection, the text is recorded in the order the selections appear, regardless of the order in which they were made.
