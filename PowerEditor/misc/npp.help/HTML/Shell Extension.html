<h1>Shell
Extension</h1>
<p>By default the Notepad++ installer comes with a Shell
extension. This is not really part of the Notepad++ program but very
useful. If you choose to install it, then any file you rightclick on
will show an entry named &#8220;Edit with Notepad++&#8221; with the Notepad++
icon.<p>
Please
note that to install or remove the extension, it sometimes is
required to restart the Explorer process. For this you can reboot,
logout and log back in or use the task manager to kill explorer
(Windows NT and up) and restart it again. You can do this by hitting <span class="shortcut">Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Del</span>.
<p>If the Shell extension is
already installed, the Notepad++ installer cannot update or overwrite
it, you first have to uninstall it and restart Explorer. 
<p>If you issue the install command for the dll, which is <tt>regsvr32 /i NppShell.dll</tt>, a dialog box will pop up from which various details of the behaviour of the extension can be tweaked.
