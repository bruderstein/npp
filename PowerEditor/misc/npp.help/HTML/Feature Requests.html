<h1>Feature Requests</h1>
<p>If
you have a (very) good idea on how to improve Notepad++, you can
request a feature using <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/ideatorrent/notepad-plus/ideatorrent/">IdeaTorrent</a>. You can also use the Feature Request tracker
(<a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?group_id=95717&amp;atid=612385">http://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?group_id=95717&amp;atid=612385</a>), even though this facility may be phased out at some point. Using IdeaTorrent allows for competing solutions for a given issue, and voting for these so-called solutions.
If your feature hasn't been asked for before, you can do so here, or vote for an already proposed solution. 
<p>There is no
guarantee it will be added however; what is a great feature for one
person might be a big nuisance for another, or it simply is too
difficult or time consuming to add it in. They are hints as to what are the most wished-for additions or modifications to the software, and they will be considered on the basis of urgency, popularity, available developer time and technical feasibility.
<p>Also, some feature requests would involve modifying the Scintilla component, which would prove unpractical. In such a case, the feature request would be better filed with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scintilla/">the Scintilla project</a>. When this project upgrades the Scintilla component, and when Notepad++ can take advantage of the new versions, all the new features become available - they may have been asked for by people who never heard of Notepad++ -, and the large tester pool for Scintilla will have probably weeded out any possible bugs therein.
