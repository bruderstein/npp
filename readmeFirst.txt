What is Notepad++ ?
===================

Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several programming languages and natural languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.


To build Notepad++ package from source code:
============================================

There should be several ways to generate Notepad++ binaries, here we show you only the way with which Notepad++ official releases are generated.
* notepad++.exe: Visual Studio 2005
* SciLexer.dll: VC++ 6

Notepad++ Unicode release binary (notepad++.exe) and Scintilla release binary (SciLexer.dll) will be built in the directories "notepad++\trunk\PowerEditor\bin" and "notepad++\trunk\scintilla\bin" respectively.
You have to copy SciLexer.dll in "notepad++\PowerEditor\bin" in order to launch notepad++.exe
